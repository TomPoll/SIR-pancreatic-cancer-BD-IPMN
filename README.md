# SIR-pancreatic-cancer-BD-IPMN
A method to calculate the number of expected cases of pancreatic cancer in a cohort of patients under surveillance

The attached R Markdown serves as a guide to replicate the methods used in the associated study "Surveillance for Presumed BD-IPMN of the Pancreas: Stability, Size, and Age Identify Targets for Discontinuation". 
Please cite our study if you are planning on using the shared code.

In the markdown a random generated dataset is used. The dataset to be used for this analysis is a long dataset, where every row correspond to a new patient and every column to a different variable.
